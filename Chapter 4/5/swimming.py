# 1. They swim for the same time because when the temperature is set to 80.5 they both swim for 4 minutes. 
# 2. If I enter 78, Gallant swims for 0 minutes while Goofus swims for 1 minute. 
# 3. Gallant checks the water temperature before diving in. 
# 4. Goofus dives in before checking the water temperature.
# 5. The first while loop checks the condition before executing the code block while the second while loop
# checks for the condition after executing the code block.
# 6. The first loop would be a pre-test loop while the second loop woudl be a post-test loop.
